# My HTML / CSS Projects

This page contains HTML/CSS projects I have created. I am looking for resources that guide me to creating projects. Still, I am looking for projects in a beginner level as I am start learning about Web Development.

I look from this resource [Projects to Practice HTML & CSS Skill for Beginners](https://medium.com/@avicndugu/projects-to-practice-html-css-skills-for-beginners-8b9ed67a7dd1) and from coding exercises.

An assignment from CS50 course. The instructor assigned students to create Google Search Clone Page similar to the original Google page as much as possible.
Most importantly, I have learnt how to use <form>, Get, POST.
